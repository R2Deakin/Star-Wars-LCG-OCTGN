Special thanks to R2Deakin for adding scripts for Endor Han and Secret Objective fate cards 
to disengage the current objective and ask which eligible target (objectives and mission if available)
to move the engagement to. It currently includes the engaged objective; work is ongoing to not include
the currently engaged objective in the eligible target list.

Current known issues:
-Capturing at missions not currently working
-Missions do not pause for reactions upon leaving play, must be done manually

Further improvements will be added to mission functionality as they are successfully tested.
